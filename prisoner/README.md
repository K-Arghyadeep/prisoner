This project includes an amateur attempt to simulate a riddle using python.
Any other language could have used i guess but i chose python because i like PYTHON.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- 100 prisoners numbered 1-100
- Slips with their numbers are randomly placed in 100 boxes in a room
- Each prisoner may enter the room one at a time and check 50 boxes
- They must leave the room exactly as theu found it and can't communicate with the others after
- if all 100 prisoner find their number during their turn in the room, they will all be freed. But if even one fails, they will all be executed.

What is the best strategy.
