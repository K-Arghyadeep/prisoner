In this strategy the prisoners open the box with their number on. Then they will open the box whose number was inside the previous box.
Doing so the prisoners will open the boxes in a loop.
Although there is no gurantee that they will be able to escape, it's still better to follow an algorithm rather than being complete random.


Example:
prisoner number 54 will open:
54:35 -> 35:21 -> 21:19 -> 19:91 -> 91:54

or a loop which involves 50+ turns to find their slip inside the box
